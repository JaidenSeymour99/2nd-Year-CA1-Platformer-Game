# Second-Year-CA1-Platformer-Game
Game created in Javascript using the Phaser library 
This game runs in the browser, you need to use a webserver to have the file work. I used the Web server for chrome extension which lets you chose the file folder that needs the webserver to run and paste http://127.0.0.1:8887 into your browser. This will run the index.html file and start the game.
